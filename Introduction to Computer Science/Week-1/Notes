Week 1 - C

printf("Hello World")
//prints hello world onto console

file names need to use .c
ex: hello.c

clang - name of program that exists to compile code
compiles the code
ex: clang hello.c

  clang -o hello hello.c
  //you can rename file to whatever you want
  //clan -o {what you want} {filename}

  clang -o string string.c -lcs50
  //added line that tells computer to link with CS50 source

./hello
//runs program hello

string answer = get_string("What's your name?\n");
//set variable to answer and ask for string "whats your name?"

string is a sequence within double quotes
ex: "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"

STORING NUMBER



int counter = 0;
//storing a number

counter = counter + 1
counter++
//counter is variable which is "initial number" + 1

if (condition){
  do this
} do that
//if statement that checks that if condition is true, do the line of code inside, otherwise do outside

while (condition){
  do this
}
// while the condition is true, do this

bool - true/false
char - single character
int - integer
string - thing inside double quotes
long - wider number that can go higher than 4 billion
